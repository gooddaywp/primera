## SCSS & PostCSS Plugins

[SASS](//sass-lang.com/) or [SCSS](//sass-lang.com/) is a CSS extension that supplies some [really cool features](//sass-lang.com/guide/) to CSS.

[PostCSS](//postcss.org) is a JavaScript framework which processes CSS files. Primera includes the following PostCSS plugins.
- [PropertyLookup](//github.com/simonsmith/postcss-property-lookup)
- [Easings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-easings)
- [MQPacker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-mqpacker)

## Browser Support

While writing CSS you do not need to worry about writing browser prefixes. The autoprefixer PostCSS plugin supplied via CSSNext will do that for you. To see or change which browsers are supported you can simply change the `browserlist` inside `package.json` using [this guide](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).

Please also remember that [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) can't help older browsers understand CSS properties which they simply do not support. For a great place to check which browser supports what visit [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/).

## Translation

1) While developing, wrap any hard coded translatable text strings in their [appropriate WP function](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/#localization-functions).
2) Revisit `gulpfile.js` and make sure the `domain` property inside `wpPot()` matches your theme's text domain.
3) Run `gulp potfile` to create a `.pot` file inside the languages folder.
4) To translate the `.pot` file and create the necessary `.po` and `.mo` files, you can use either [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).
