## Translation

1) While developing, wrap any hard coded translatable text strings in their [appropriate WP function](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/#localization-functions).
2) Revisit `gulpfile.js` and make sure the `domain` property inside `wpPot()` matches your theme's text domain.
3) Run `gulp potfile` to create a `.pot` file inside the languages folder.
4) To translate the `.pot` file and create the necessary `.po` and `.mo` files, you can use either [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).

## Theme Updates
Update conflicts with themes from wordpress.org arise from themes having identical folder names. To avoid such conflicts, simply make sure that your theme's folder name is unique (e.g. via a prefix).

## Versioning
To update your themes version, as found inside the `style.css` file, simply bump the version inside your `package.json` file and run `gulp` or `gulp cssmin`.
